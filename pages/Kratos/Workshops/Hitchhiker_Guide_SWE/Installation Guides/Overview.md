The following part of the guide will show you all the necessary tools to be prepared for the Structural Wind Engineering (SWE) course and the project work. The guide contains the necessary steps for the installation of the tools and a couple of tips to get started. It is advised to go through all the installation steps, without neglecting any parts, in order to avoid potential errors when using the tools during the course.

It is important to note that, given the annual organization of the Structural Wind Engineering (SWE) course, the mandatory program versions may be subject to modification. As such, participants will be clarified regarding the specific versions required during the course.
